%\section{\mysidestyle Objective}
%	I am looking for a three month internship to begin March. I'll need to be allowed to work from Rochester, NY.

\section{\mysidestyle Summary}
	I love to tinker. I enjoy spending my time working on personal projects. Some of the notable projects I have worked on include the Linux kernel and the Gentoo Linux distribution.  I have become very good at picking up new ideas quickly, and expanding what I already know with a direction and my own research.

		\small
		Currently working on the Kernel team for the \href{http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/}{Chromebook}. My work centers around the creation of a unit test which analyzes the kernel-to-kernel latency of input events, and the associated frameworks to make this test possible. This work involves adding trace events into the Linux kernel, X input drivers, and the Chromium browser; then building tools to analyze traces generated by these events.
