  Objective
    I am looking for a three to six month co-op starting June.

  Summary
    I am a person who loves to tinker. I spend the majority of my free time
    working on personal projects. Some of the projects I have worked on
    include the Linux kernel and the Gentoo Linux distribution. As a result,
    I've found that I have become very good at picking up new ideas quickly,
    and expanding what I already know with little more than the internet and
    a direction.
